# About Me

**Professional Summary**

I am a highly driven cybersecurity professional specializing in the defense and operational efficiency of enterprise environments. My core passion is **Blue Team Operations**, focusing on proactive threat mitigation within the Security Operations Center (SOC). I bring practical, hands-on experience in the full incident lifecycle—from SIEM deployment and custom **Threat Detection** development (Splunk, Python) to executing **Incident Response** procedures.

As an MSCM Candidate (Expected Dec 2026), I am actively seeking full-time roles in **SOC Analysis, Security Monitoring, or Incident Response**. I leverage technical controls (Palo Alto Firewalls) to enforce compliance (HIPAA, PII Data Handling) and maintain a robust defense posture.
